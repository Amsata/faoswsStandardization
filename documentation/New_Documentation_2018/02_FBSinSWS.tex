\section*{Variables of The FBS}\label{variables-of-the-fbs}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Variables of The FBS}

The process of creating FBSs starts by collecting all data for the
different variables of the \emph{Food Balance Sheet} equation\footnote{For
  definitions and an extended description of the motivation behind the
  development of FBS, see FAO, 2001, \emph{Food Balance Sheets: A
  Handbook}, available at:
  \url{http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X9892E/X9892E00.HTM}. Accessed on
  19 January 2017. Moreover see \emph{Standardization \& Balancing for
  Food Balance Sheet Calculation}, in the \emph{Standardization \&
  Balancing} module's documentation on
  \href{https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/tree/master/documentation}{\emph{GitHub}}}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:balance1}
P_{ijt} + I_{ijt} - X_{ijt} - \Delta St_{ijt} = FP_{ijt} + Fo_{ijt} + Fe_{ijt} + Lo_{ijt} + Se_{ijt} + IU_{ijt} + T_{ijt}  + ROU_{ijt}
\end{equation}

where the \(i\) index runs over all countries, the \(j\) index over all
commodities, and \(t\) over years and where, dropping indices for
brevity:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P\)=Production
\item
  \(I\)=Imports
\item
  \(X\)=Exports
\item
  \(S\)=Stock level
\item
  \(\Delta St_{t}\) = Stock Variation = \(St_{t} - St_{t-1}\)
\item
  \(FP_{ijt}\) = Food Processing
\item
  \(Fo\)=Food availability
\item
  \(Fe\)=Feed
\item
  \(Lo\)=Losses
\item
  \(Se\)=Seed
\item
  \(IU\)=industrial use
\item
  \(T\)=Tourist consumption
\item
  \(ROU\)=Residual Other Use
\item
  \(TS = Total supply = P_{ijt} + I_{ijt} - \Delta St_{ijt}\)
\end{itemize}

At international level, the primary data source that FAO uses to compile
the the Supply Utilization Accounts/Food Balance Sheets are the data as
collected through the annual \emph{Agriculture Production
Questionnaires}. Unfortunately, measured values are mostly limited to
variables on the supply side (production, imports and exports), while,
on the demand side, most values are imputed data\footnote{For more
  details on FBS variables please see the latest version of the
  \emph{Resource Book}}. The Variables of the FBS are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Production (P)}: Data on production are data at farmgate level.
  As data on production are very important for countries, these data are
  very often survey-based data. Nevertheless, not all countries collect
  data of production for all commodities. Therefore other data
  collection methods are used, like records of private firms and
  commodity organization. When no other data are available, Production
  figures are imputed or estimated. Imputation and estimation procedures
  depends on the specific commodity. There are different procedures for
  crops and livestock but all based on an \emph{ensemble approach}.
  Production data in the FBS framework are collected, imputed or
  estimated for all the primary commodities and for a set of derived
  commodities\footnote{See \emph{Production module} documentation for
    more details on procedures and list of commodities}.
\item
  \emph{Import(I) and Export(X)}: Data on Trade are, mainly, official
  from international trade databases, like UNSD and EUROSTAT, at HS6
  commodity level\footnote{Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding
    Systems (HS) is an internationalclassification of products held by
    UNSD. Is made of six-digit level codes and used worldwide for
    trading data classifications. See official
    \href{https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/50018/Harmonized-Commodity-Description-and-Coding-Systems-HS}{\emph{HS6
    UNSD webpage}} for mode details}. Official data are integrated with
  supplementary data having the main aim of filling in all the
  information hidden by the unrecorded trade and coming, mainly, from
  trading partners. HS6 classification is more detailed than the used
  CPC classiffication, therefore, these data are aggregated in CPC
  commodities before being used in the standardization process\footnote{See
    \href{https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsTrade/blob/master/vignettes/Documentation/tradeDocumentation.pdf}{\emph{Trade
    module}} documentation for more details}.
\item
  \emph{Stock Variation (}\(\Delta St_{t})\): In the FBS framework,
  stocks are considered as \emph{changes in stocks} from one time period
  to the next. Moreover they are considered as a component of supply.
  Therefore, the \(-\) sign indicates that the stock is decreased, which
  means that the stocks are available as a supply, while the \(+\) sign
  indicates that the stocks have increased and they are, therefore,
  considered as a utilization for that commodity. Changes in stocks are
  tipically limited to a short number of commodities, mainly grains,
  pulses and sugar and, because they are very rarely measured by
  country, figures are very often imputed or estimated\footnote{For a
    complete list of stock commodities and for details about the
    imputation methodology, please refer to specific documentation for
    stock}. Estimation of \emph{changes in stock} is based on opening
  stocks figures throught an approach that mantain time consistency of
  available data and official data\footnote{All data are marked as
    \emph{official}, \emph{semi-official} or \emph{unofficial},
    depending on the source they come from, throught \emph{flags}. Flag
    management is one of the core responsibilities of the \emph{Office
    of the Chief Statistician} Department in FAO. Flags are used from
    all the estimation procedure for distinguishing between different
    level of reliability in the data. The most reliable data are used to
    estimate missing or less reliable data.{[}this has to be better
    specified{]}}.
\item
  \emph{Food availability (Fo)}: Food availability is defined as the
  quantity of any substance that is available for human consumption at
  the retail level by the country's resident population during a given
  reference period. Official data of food availability come from
  questionnaires, industrial ouptut surveys and household consumption or
  expenditure surveys. When these sources of data are not available,
  food availability data are imputated or estimated. Not all CPC
  commodities are Food commodities, as not all commodities are used for
  human consumption. Food commodities are divided in two main groups:
  \emph{Food Estimates} and \emph{Food Residual} and estimated
  differently depending on the pertaining group, respectively as linear
  or logaritmic function of income elasticity of demand, GDP per capita,
  and population, or as residual quantity of production and net trade
  quantities\footnote{For a complete list of food commodities of the two
    typologies and for details about the imputation methodology, please
    refer to specific documentation for Food availablity}.
\item
  \emph{Feed (Fe)}: Feed demand is increasing because of the increase in
  income of developing countries. Animal feed may vary among countries
  due to the difference in livestock and the diversity of commodity used
  for livestock's rations. Official feed demand data might be available
  from specific questionnaires. Even when available, these data need to
  be cross-checked against livestock availability in terms of
  requirements. When official data, and also other sources of
  semi-official data, are not available, feed data are estimated as a
  function of livestock availability and livestock feed demand in terms
  of energy and protein requirements, in accordance with an inventory of
  the potential feed supply's products of any country.
\item
  \emph{Seed (Se)}: Official seed data may come from agricultural
  surveys, while other sources of data might be found in some technical
  publication. When data are not available these are estimated as a
  function of a seeding rate and a sown area in the following year.
\item
  \emph{Tourism Consumption (T)}: Tourism consumption is considered here
  as a separate utilization variable, while in the past it was included
  in the ``other utilization'' catchall cathegory. Official data for
  this variable are rare and may come from tourism offices or collected
  by tourism boards through surveys. UNWTO is an alternative source of
  data, but other authorities might also be used. Imputations and
  estimations of tourist food are made as a function of food figures.
\item
  \emph{Industrial Use (IU)}: This variable refers to utilization of any
  food items in any non-food industry. Non-food use of food commodities
  is growing and is highly context and country specific. For this reason
  there are not, at the moment, suggestions on how to impute and
  estimate missing figures. As a consequence, Industrial data available
  for Food Balance Sheets are only those coming from Official or
  unofficial sources. At the moment the data used comes from USDA and
  from questionnaries.
\item
  \emph{Loss (L)}: FAO has developed the Global Food Loss Index (GFLI)
  that focuses on the supply-side aspects of improving the efficiency of
  global food supply chains. The index is based on a set of primary
  commodities that are key in agricultural production systems, including
  crops, livestock, and fisheries. In order to track losses without
  compounding production variability, losses are expressed as a
  percentage and are aggregated using fixed quantities and prices. The
  primary data source that FAO uses for compiling GFLI are loss factors
  as collected by Questionnaires. Other sources are publications and
  reports from subnational reports, academic institutions, international
  organizations and so on. The missing data are imputed using a
  hyerarchical model based on commodity groups\footnote{ask for links to
    a proper documentation}.
\item
  \emph{Residual and other use (ROU)}: ROU is used to capture categories
  of products that do not follow in any other category and that might be
  considered ``not important'' for the FBS scope. Normally, these
  residual commodities are different from country to country and for
  this reason they fall in this variable. ROU are set not to be higher
  that 5\% of total supply and are calculated at-post as absorbing
  element, in the sense that it absorbs part or all of the imbalance
  that may exist, at FBS commodity aggregate level, after the
  standardization process. Any imbalance bigger than 5\% of total supply
  is balanced thrugh a balancing mechanism that will be later specified.
\item
  \emph{Food Processing (FP)}: This variable represents the amount of
  the availability of a commodity that enters a manufacturing process to
  be transformed into a derived commodity. Food processing is not
  officially measured, nor collected via official sources. This variable
  is entirely calculated during the standardization process by applying
  extraction rates to the amount of production of the derived commodity.
  This will be better specified in section \emph{2-Step2} of the present
  document.
\end{itemize}

The data of each variable are generally checked and imputed in time
series. The set of operations required for creating/checking time series
of data for each variable is called \emph{module}. A
\textbf{\emph{module}}, in the FBS Framework, is an R-script, written by
an R-developer and integrate inside the \textbf{\emph{Statistical
Working System (SWS)}}\footnote{SWS is an internal Working System
  providing a platform for statisticians and statistical clers to
  collect, collate, validate and correct data. Moreover, the platfors
  supports the possibility of performing imputations of data based on
  statisticians' knowledge and development.} by means of \emph{plugins}.
There is at least one module (there might be more) for each variable of
the FBS. Each module produces figures that are collected in a dataset
inside the SWS for future uses or publication. Output data of a module
may become input data of another module, this circumstance creating a
precise sequence for the execution of a complete FBS.

\section{The Overall Workflow of the
FBS}\label{the-overall-workflow-of-the-fbs}

The \emph{Standardiation \& Balancing} process is presented in Figure
\ref{fig:f9}. It involves 5 main steps and requires a some auxiliary
information table.

\item
  Data Pull,
\item
  Sua Filling,
\item
  Standardization,

All the steps and the table will be described across the present
document, after having introduced the the basic equation of FBS and the
\emph{Commodity tree} which represents the structure of the set of
commodity involved in the Food Balance Sheets.

\section*{Commodity Tree}\label{commodity-tree}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Commodity Tree}

The process of combining commodity balances for creating Food Balance
Sheets is based on a structured and clear set of relationships between
commodity given by the \emph{Commodity tree}. The majority of the
commodities are produced from one (or more) commodity (/ies), called
\emph{parent} commodity(/ies), and/or are themselfes parent of one (or
more) \emph{child} (\emph{children}) commodity (/ies). These structure
creates an intense and articulated network of relationships at different
levels: primary commodities, like crops, are \emph{parent} commodities
and, also, \emph{zero-level} commodities from which \emph{children}
commodities of \emph{level-1} are produced, which are in turn, used to
produce other commodities of a gradually \emph{``lower''} level. In
commodtity trees, the bigger the level number, the lower the processing
level. There are as many commodity trees as the number of process chains
in a country. Fundamental characteristics of commodity trees
are\footnote{For a more detailed description of commodity trees, please
  see the specific documentation. The reference document, at the moment
  is the \emph{tecnical conversion factor} document available in the
  documentation folder on
  \href{https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsStandardization/tree/master/documentation}{\emph{GitHub}}}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Each commodity tree is represented as a flowchart of the kind
  presented in Figure \ref{fig:f2} where:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{nodes}} represent commodities,
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{edges}} represent production processes ,
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{joints}} indicate where a single production process
    creates more that one commodity. These commodities are, then, called
    \emph{by-products} or \emph{co-products}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/StandBal/02_WheatTree} 

}

\caption{\label{fig:f2}Commodity Tree for Wheat in China mainland 2014}\label{fig:f2}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Not all the countries have the same production processes, because
  countries have different technologies and primary products
  availabilities. Therefore, the commodity trees are not the same across
  countries.
\item
  if a production process is active in a country, this is expressed
  throught the existence of a conversion factor called
  \textbf{\emph{extraction Rate}}. An Extraction rate (\(eR\))
  represents how much amount of the child commodity is produced from 1
  unit of parent commodity. It is expressed as a ratio of the processed
  product obtained from the processing of the parent/originating
  product.
\item
  Some child commodities can be produced starting from more that one
  parent commodity. A second conversion factor exists representing the
  amount of a child commodity that is produced from each parent
  commodity. This conversion factor is called \textbf{\emph{Share}}.
  Shares represent the amount of the child commodity that is produced
  from the specified parent and are expressed as a ratio. Shares are
  generically defined as:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sharesGen}
s_{cp} = \frac{availability_{p(c)}}{\sum \limits_{p=1}^A{availability_{p(c)}}}
\end{equation}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
where \(availability_{p(c)}\) is the availability of each parent \(p\)
of child \(c\) expressed in terms of \(c\) (in \emph{child equivalent}).
\end{quote}

Commodity trees are presented in tables like Table 10, which represents
the same example of Figure \ref{fig:f2}. In the table each production
process is represented in a separate row.

There are some concepts linked to the \emph{Commodity tree} framework:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Proxy-Primary}} commodities. These are a set of
  commodities that are children of other commodities but, because they
  are important in representing the food availability of a country, are
  not aggregated to their primary commodities, but are kept separated.
  These commodities are \emph{cut} from the tree of the primary
  commodity/ies and, if they can be processed in other products, have
  their own commodity tree. The name \emph{proxy-primary} is assigned
  because they are considered as primary-commodities in the
  \emph{Standardization \& Balancing} process.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{No-Tree}} commodities. These are \emph{zero-level}
  commodities that are primary commodities and are never processed in
  other products. As they are not involved in any production process,
  there is no tree associated to them. Notice that, even a commodity
  that is included in the commodity tree of one Country, might be a
  No-tree commodity for another country or another year, if no
  production processes have been activated for that specific Country or
  year.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Pull}\label{data-pull}

The process of creating FBSs starts by considering the initial commodity
balance for each CPC commodity, either primary and derived, with the
different variables of the equation (as listed and briefly described in
the previous section) filled with figures as available from official or
other sources and from imputation and estimation methods, when applied.
In other words, the process starts by pulling figures inside a so-called
\emph{Sua Unbalanced}. In this initial account, food processing and ROU
figures are not available (because they, by default, will be measured
during the process), whereas the figures for all other variables have
been already collected, imputed and estimated through a specific
\emph{module} (Figure \ref{fig:f1}).

A \textbf{\emph{module}}, in the FBS Framework, is an R-script, written
by an R-developer, for the execution of a set of operations (either data
import, manipulation, imputation or estimation) required for compiling
the time series of one variable. There is at least one module (there
might be more) for each variable of the FBS. Each module produces
figures that are collected in a dataset inside the
\textbf{\emph{Statistical Working System (SWS)}}\footnote{SWS is an
  internal Working System providing a platform for statisticians and
  statistical clers to collect, collate, validate and correct data.
  Moreover, the platfors supports the possibility of performing
  imputations of data based on statisticians' knowledge and development.}.Output
data of a module may become input data of another module, this
circumstance creating a precise sequence for the execution of a complete
FBS. In the present document, we are analyzing the workflow of the
Standardization process as starts after all the modules have run and
have produced reliable data or each variable. The detailed description
of the workflow for the execution of all the modules of the FBS will be
given in a separate document.\footnote{{[}report the document when it
  will be available{]}}.

\subsection*{the Initial Sua
Unbalanced}\label{the-initial-sua-unbalanced}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{the Initial Sua Unbalanced}

After pulling all data, the process of compiling Food Balance Sheets is
a non-complete supply-utilization account. The non-completeness of the
SUAs is due to different reasons: first, as already said, some variables
are not collected, nor estimated before the process begins, second there
is the model for industrial use that does not impute or estimate data,
but just collects data from different sources, this opening the strong
possibility not to have values where they are supposed to exist and,
also, not guaranteeing consistency of data over time. Thirdly, modules
might, sometimes, fail in the imputation, because of the strong
complexity and structural diversity of the input data.
